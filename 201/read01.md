# Introduction
In order to teach you about creating web pages, 
this book is divided into three sections:   
1.HTML  
We will spend the first chapter looking at how HTML is used to create web pages.  
2. CSS       
We start this section with a chapter that explains how CSS uses rules to enable you to control the styling and layout of web pages. 
  There are properties in Css like 
  * Presentation: How to control 
things like the color of text, the 
fonts you want to use and the 
size of those fonts,      

 
 * Layout: How to control where 
the different elements are 
positioned on the screen.

3.Practical  
 We end up with some helpful information that will assist you in building better websites.

 ## How People Access the Web
 There are different ways in which people access the web 
and clarify some terminology:
* Browsers
People access websites using 
software called a web browser. 
Popular examples include 
Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, 
Chrome, and Opera.

* Web Servers
When you ask your browser for 
a web page, the request is sent 
across the Internet to a special 
computer known as a web 
server which hosts the website.

* Screen readers
Screen readers are programs 
that read out the contents of a 
computer screen to a user. They 
are commonly used by people 
with visual impairments.

## How the Web Works

When you visit a website, the web server 
hosting that site could be anywhere in the 
world. In order for you to find the location of 
the web server, your browser will first connect 
to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

## Structure of HTML
* Understanding structure
* Learning about markup
* Tags and elements

The <HTML> is a markup language that is used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content to display it in the required format.
Tags in HTML: Tags are one of the most important part in an HTML Document. HTML uses some predefined tags which tells the browser about content display property, that is how to display a particular given content. For Example, to create a paragraph, one must use the paragraph tags(<p> </p>) and to insert an image one must use the img tags(<img />).  

There are generally two types of tags in HTML:  
1. Paired Tags: These tags come in pairs. That is they have both opening(< >) and closing(</ >) tags.  
2. Empty Tags: These tags do not require to be closed.
Below is an example of (<b>) tag in HTML, which tells the browser to bold the text inside it.

 ## Extra Markup 


* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you 
are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the 
<!-- and --> markers.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify 
particular elements.
* The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group 
block-level and inline elements together.
* <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through 
which other pages can be displayed.
* The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of 
information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special 
characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.

## HTML5 Layout

HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the 
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content 
you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not 
stopped many web page authors using them already.

Examples of elements
* Headers & Footers 
* Navigation
* Articles
* Aside,Sections
* Heading group
* Figures 
*  section elements.

## Process & Design
Every website should be designed for the 
target audience—not just for yourself or the 
site owner. It is therefore very important to 
understand who your target audience is.  
It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.
Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.  
You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.
 ## Introduction To JS
 To get the most out of this book, you will need to know how to bui ld web pages using HTML and CSS. Beyond that. no prior experience with programming is necessary. Learning to program with JavaScript involves:

Understanding some basic programming concepts and the terms that JavaScript programmers use to describe them.
2.Learning the language itself, and, like all languages, you need to know its vocabulary and how to structure your sentences.

Becoming familiar with how it is applied by looking at examples of how JavaScript is commonly used in websites today.
The only equipment you need to use this book are a computer with a modern web browser installed, and your favorite code editor, (e.g., Notepad, TextEdit. Sublime Text. or Coda)

## The ABC of JS programming 
 WHat is Script 
 A script is a series of instructions that a 
computer can follow to achieve a goal. 
To write a script, you need to first 
state your goal and then list the 
tasks that need to be completed in 
order to achieve it. 
A script is a series of instructions that the computer 
can follow in order to achieve a goal. 
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of 
all the instructions. 
Computers approach tasks in a different way than 
humans, so your instructions must let the computer 
solve the task prggrammatically. 
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into 
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed 
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
