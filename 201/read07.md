## HTML Tables


HTML tables allow the developers for data arrangement by inserting them in rows & columns. The HTML table is defined with the **table** tag & for each row it is defined with the **tr** tag & each table header is defined with the **th** tag & each data is defined with the **td** tag. For styling tables, developers can use borders either through the HTML or CSS in which the border lines can be thicker or thinner depending on the developer's choice.

For creating long tables, there are 3 elements that are different from the main content of the table in which the first & last rows contain different content. Those allow the developer to style these sections in a different manner than the table itself. Those elements are:
* thead - It is based on the header content of the HTML table
* tbody - It is based on grouping the body content of the HTML table
* tfoot - It is based on grouping the footer content in the HTML table.

## Objects


Creating  an object on Javascript is based on using a combination of the properties & methods that are needed for the object. The function that is used to in the object is based on a method which allows the developer to update the value of properties by using dot & bracket notations. The developer can create many objects as he wants to, but sometimes he must represent the object in a similar fashion. For example, object constructors can use the function as a template for creating objects, but at the same time it consists of properties & methods.

To add & remove properties from an object the developer must assure that once he created the object, he can add new properties to it & for adding properties, it uses the dot notation in terms of calling the function. As for removing the properties, it uses the keyword **delete** & like the adding process, it uses the dot notation to identify the property or method that the developer chooses to remove.

Arrays are variables which holds more than one value which are listed in a way that they are related to each other. They are very useful because it specifies the list of items that are displayed & at the same time, it holds the number of values in which the developer can implement. However, arrays are also considered as objects in Javascript in which it has a set of related values & each value has an index number. Arrays are inserted in an object when the property can hold the array, but if the objects are inside the array then the property are considered as index numbers.
