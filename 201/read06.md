## JavaScript object literal
A JavaScript object literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces. Object literals encapsulate data, enclosing it in a tidy package. This minimizes the use of global variables which can cause problems when combining code.

The following demonstrates an example object literal:

var myObject = {
    sProp: 'some string value',
    numProp: 2,
    bProp: false
};

# Document Object Model  
 is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them one can change the structure, style or content of a document. Nodes can have event handlers attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.

## Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming  
### What is the hardest thing about writing code?  


+ Explaining what I do (or don't do.  
+ Estimating time to complete tasks.  
+ Dealing with other people.  
+ Working with someone else's code.  
+ Implementing functionality you disagree with.  
+ Writing documentation.  
+ Writing tests.
