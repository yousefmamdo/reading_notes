# ReactJS | Components
A Component is one of the core building blocks of React. In other words, we can say that every application you will develop in React will be made up of pieces called components. Components make the task of building UIs much easier. You can see a UI broken down into multiple individual pieces called components and work on them independently and merge them all in a parent component which will be your final UI. 
You can see in the below image we have broken down the UI of GeeksforGeeks’s homepage into individual components.

## Why use a component?
+ One-way data binding.
+ React native.
+ Speed and efficiency.
##
While a component can’t change its own props, it can change its state…Props and state are used as input for the render() method to determine its output. The render() method also calls the diff algorithm which recognizes any changes in the component and logs them for batching to the “real” DOM.
