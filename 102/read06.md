## Cascading Style Sheets
 + ### allows you to create great-looking web pages.CSS is a rule-based language â€” you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on my page to be shown as large red text.  
 "h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}  
### There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:  
1. **External CSS**  
*** With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section. ***
2. **Internal CSS**  
***An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.***

3. **Inline CSS**  
***An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.***
