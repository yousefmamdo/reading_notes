  frameworks are an essential part of modern front-end web development, providing developers with proven tools for building scalable, interactive web applications. This module gives you some fundamental background knowledge about how client-side frameworks work and how they fit into your toolset, before moving on to tutorial series covering some of today's most popular ones.  
  JavaScript provides three different value-comparison operations: strict equality using ===, loose equality using ==, and the Object.is() method.
  + ## Input and Output in JS   
  n the JavaScript code we have a function called say_hi. It used the getElementById we have already seen to locate the DOM element representing the input element with the id first_name. The object returned has a method value that will return the text the user has typed in that field.

We use this technique to retrieve the content of both input fields and assign their content to two variables: fname and lname.

Then, using these variable we create an HTML snippet and assign it to a new variable called html.
