# ** Summary Git Tutorial **



## * Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.*

## So, what is Git?
+ Snapshots
###### Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots.   
+ Local Operations
###### This allows for process expediency because a projectâ€™s history resides on the local disk.  
+ Tracking Changes   
###### Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git.  
+ Loss of Data   
######  Git is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidentally lost data.
